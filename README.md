# Astronomy_Final_Project
This project implements a parallelized 3D self-gravitating N-body simulation using a Particle–Mesh (PM) framework in C++. The simulation solves the Poisson equation for gravitational potential using FFT-based spectral methods and evolves particle trajectories using a symplectic leapfrog integrator.

The code is designed to demonstrate large-scale numerical modeling, high-performance computing techniques, and efficient grid–particle coupling methods commonly used in computational physics and cosmological simulations.
